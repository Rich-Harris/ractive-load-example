# ractive-load-example

Quick and dirty demo of [ractive-load](https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive-load) being used to load [ractive component files](https://github.com/ractivejs/component-spec/).

## How to run it

Clone this repo...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rich-Harris/ractive-load-example.git
cd ractive-load-example
```

...and serve this folder. I like using [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) to quickly serve a folder:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

By default it will serve to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

(You can't just double-click on the `index.html` file, because you can't make AJAX requests to the filesystem.)
